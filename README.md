# Task7_elevatelabs

This project demonstrates how to:
1. Create a small SQLite database  with a single `sales` table  
2. Populate the table with example data (product, quantity, price)  
3. Query the database from Python using `sqlite3` and `pandas`  
4. Visualize the results with a simple bar chart (`matplotlib`)
5.  Save the chart as `sales_chart.png`
